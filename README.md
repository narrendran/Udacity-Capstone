# Udacity-Capstone
Stock price prediction for udacity's Machine learning engineering nanodegree program

This project aims to build and compare various Supervised learning techniques to predict stock price.  
The data set used is historical prices and volumes of all the companies in S&P 500, which is queried from [
(https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NSE-TATAGLOBAL11.csv)  
Techniques Applied are
1.	Moving Average
2.	Linear Regression
3.	k-Nearest Neighbors
4.	Pyramid ARIMA
5.	Prophet
6.	Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

All the code and result can be found in the `main_code.ipynb`.  
The project proposal is the `proposal.pdf`, and the final report is the `report.pdf`.
